### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Aarushi Johly, theoretical mathematician by qualification and machine learning engineer by profession.
I graduated in Masters in Mathematics from Miranda House, University of Delhi, where my masters is specialized in pure mathematics with a strong focus on Topology. In my post grad I also have studied the subject of machine learning.

Initially, my goal was to pursue Ph.D. in Topology or Algebraic Geometry but the recent developments in LLMs shifted my lifes focus to NLP. Thus, life now is all about developing and deploying AI models. I have 
Skills:
1. Programming langyages and their libraries:
  i. PYTHON: Numpy, pandas, matplotlib, Scikit Learn, PyTorch.
  ii. C++: STL
2. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING: LLM, transformer architecture, attention mechanism.
3. DEEP LEARNING: RNN, LSTM, Backpropagation.
4. MACHNE LEARNING: Linear regression, Logistic regression, Support vector machines, Decision Tree, Ensemble learning, kNN, Naive Bayes, PCA, Clustering methods.
5. Data structures and algorithms (check leetcode)
6. Backend: Rest API, FastAPI, Django, Docker, Kubernetes, SQL.
7. VERSION CONTROL: GIT
